To track transactions in SQL, several data structures and concepts can be employed depending on the type of tracking you require, 
such as auditing, transaction logs, or versioning.

1. Transaction Table
A dedicated table where each row represents a transaction, containing details like transaction_id, user_id, timestamp, 
transaction_type, and other relevant metadata (amount, status, etc.).

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(50),
    transaction_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    transaction_status VARCHAR(20)
);

2. Audit Logs
This is used for tracking historical changes to data. You can create audit log tables that capture every operation on specific tables such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 
The log table may capture the before and after states of the row.

CREATE TABLE Transaction_Audit (
    audit_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_id INT NOT NULL,
    operation_type VARCHAR(10), -- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    old_value JSONB,
    new_value JSONB,
    operation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    user_id INT
);
